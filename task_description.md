# Weekly Task 1 Description

To complete the task, please read the following articles from the link provided:

1. [Lập trình C Bá đạo - Bài 4->12](https://nguyenvanhieu.vn/lap-trinh-c/)

These articles will provide you with an introduction to the "Học lập trình C bá đạo" course and essential information about setting up the programming environment for C.

----------------------------
# Main Task

## 1. Definition of Variables and Constants
   - What is the concept of variables and constants?
   - Understanding the access scopes of variables in C and exploring keywords `static`, `extern`, and `volatile` to comprehend their impact on variable behavior.
   - Exploring various methods of declaring constants, highlighting their distinctions, and providing illustrative examples for appropriate usage.

## 2. Data Types and their Value Ranges
   - Enumerating the different data types in C along with their respective value ranges.
   - Classifying data types based on their origin: Primitive, Derived, and User-defined.
   - Categorizing data types based on their representation: Integer, Floating-point, and Character.
   - Demonstrating code examples to print the size of data types in C.
   - Explaining the storage mechanisms for unsigned integers, signed integers, and floating-point numbers in computer systems.

## 3. Integer Overflow and its Occurrence
   - Defining integer overflow and identifying scenarios when it occurs.
   - Presenting at least 3 code examples showcasing integer overflow (covering distinct cases). Noting that `int a = 1000000000000000` and `char a = 100000000000000000` are the same case.
   - Discussing techniques to prevent integer overflow and providing relevant examples.

## 4. Input and Output Operations in C using `printf`/`scanf`

### 4.1. `printf`
   - Utilizing `printf` and exploring its usage. Understanding the return value of `printf`.
   - Comprehending the format specifiers and escape sequences supported by `printf` (`%d`, `%c`, ...).

### 4.2. `scanf`  
   - Utilizing `scanf` and understanding its usage. Understanding the return value of `scanf`.
   - Noting that the formats supported by `printf` are also applicable to `scanf`. Exploring the method of **inputting strings with spaces** using `scanf`.

## 5. Overview of Operators in C
   - Providing list of operators in C.
   - Noting that assignment operators also yield a value. What is the value they return? (e.g., `a = (b = 5);`).
   - Distinguishing the operational differences between `&&` and `&`, `||` and `|`.  
   Providing code examples (Hint: Can `&` replace `&&`? Can `&&` replace `&`? If replacements are possible, what are their advantages or disadvantages?).  
   Then, provide the best method to use the `&&` and `||` operators.

## 6. ASCII Codes
   - What is ASCII codes?
   - Provide a table that lists characters alongside their corresponding ASCII codes (including at least 3 columns: ASCII value in base 10, ASCII value in base 16, and the corresponding character).
   - Identifying *device control* codes, *printable* codes on the console, and *extended* codes.

## 7. Excercise
   - Write your code for [Bài 11. Bài tập In ra mã ASCII của ký tự nhập từ bàn phím](https://nguyenvanhieu.vn/in-ma-ascii-cua-ky-tu-nhap-tu-ban-phim/) and [Bài 12. Bài tập hoán vị 2 số nguyên](https://nguyenvanhieu.vn/hoan-vi-2-so-trong-c/)

# Additional Task

*** Requirements:
- For subtask 1, only use Git commands to perform Git operations.
- For subtask 2, it is allowed to use a web browser to create a repository on GitHub, but Git commands must be used to push code from the local machine to GitHub or pull code from GitHub to the local machine.
- For subtask 3, there is no need to delve too deep into Markdown. You can use tools that simplify the process as long as you can create the `readme.md` file and utilize basic Markdown formatting.

## Subtask 1: Learning to Use Git and Understanding the Git Workflow
1. Learn how to use Git, including basic commands for interacting with Git.
2. Understand the Git workflow, including concepts such as repositories, branches, commits, and merges.
3. Create your first repository

## Subtask 2: Creating a GitHub Account and Linking a Local Repository to GitHub
1. After completing the first subtask, create a GitHub account.
2. Learn how to create a repository on GitHub and link it to a local repository.
3. Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
4. Use Git commands to **push code from the local repository to GitHub** and **pull code from GitHub to the local machine**.

## Subtask 3: Converting Report Files to Markdown Format and Naming them as `readme.md`
1. Convert the report files to Markdown format.
2. You are allowed to use tools or editors like VS Code that support Markdown to create the `readme.md` file.
3. Learn the basics of Markdown formatting and apply them in the `readme.md` file.
